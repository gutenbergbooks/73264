<p>This booklet is Chapter Twenty-three
of a work already largely in
being, but of which very little will be
published in the reader’s lifetime; for
though the author has none of that
false respect for the wishes of the dead
and the privacies of contemporaries
which still causes so much avoidable
inconvenience in social life, that feeling
of delicacy towards posterity, now
so active an influence as sometimes to
shrink from exposing its members even
to existence, hinders his speaking fully.</p>

<p>Being obnoxious to the sufferings of
others, he had, in 1915, the good
fortune to acquire Mr H. G. Wells’
Time Machine. Choosing a remote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
corner of our island, and building due
safeguards against possible bumps in
time—I will not forestall the account
given in Chapter Two of his work—he
arrived at the year 2,100 (O.S.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>) with
no further damage than a slight bruise
on his knee caused by the shovel of an
archaeologist in search of human remains
thought to be of the same period
as the Cro-Magnon man.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Our Style.</p>

</div>

<p>The details of how the author was
greeted, conducted, honoured, and
spied upon are not here to be told—much
is left to the reader to infer;
<i lang="la">verb. sap.</i>, as we say. But there are two
points the latter must bear in mind:
the first that there are things the author
has bound himself not to divulge,
and which will never be known until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
they occur; the second, that he has had
to rely on his memory alone. A little
thought will make the reason plain:
although he took copious notes, and
these are in existence, they are so only
in future time, and will not become
available until the year 2,100. This
last statement, I fear, bristles with
issues, and opens up deep scientific and
philosophical questions, involving
on the one hand relativity and on the
other vitalism, which I have neither
the space nor the ability to dispose of.
But very vivid in the author’s mind is
the remembrance of his emotion on
first seeing the writing fade backwards
out of his notebooks, and becoming
bitterly aware that time was a reversible
flux. He returned to 1920, a study
of history having informed him, as far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
as he could unravel the evidence, that
his feelings would be less lacerated in
that year than seemed likely in 1915.
He then settled down to write his great
work, which he will give to the world
piecemeal as discretion permits: (the
reader has only to glance at our law
reports to see that were futurity displayed,
the enjoyment of life and that
nice adjustment of personal desires to
social duties which our time has perfected,
could not exist), and I have
persuaded him to allow me to make
known this chapter on the theatre,
which can break no bones, or even
abrade the most delicate skin.</p>

<p>I have, indeed, taken the liberty of
making some omissions in order to
brevity, and, I freely admit, for
decency’s sake; for I do not hold with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
the modern fashion of protesting that
nothing is withheld, and forthwith
teasing the reader with a series of
dots or stars.</p>

<p>Why the book is called ‘Timotheus’
will be evident to those who bear in
mind the name of the ‘Mighty
Master,’ the Wagner of Alexander
the Great’s day, who</p>

<small>THE NATIONAL THEATRE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Our air-taxi landed us at what I
took to be the nineteenth floor, and we
walked almost at once into a huge hyperboloid
pit, the walls of which consisted
of tiers of seats. It would hold,
I gathered, some twenty thousand
people, and much resembled a Roman
theatre, except for the peculiar curve
of the walls, and the seats continuing
to the very bottom of the funnel.
There was no sign of any stage, and on
my questioning Fabian,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he pointed to
the saucer-like dome which formed the
roof, or lid of the building. I was afraid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
that to keep my eyes fixed upon this
airy stage would mean ricking my neck,
but I was reassured on being shown the
shape of our seats. Not only were they
well slanted back, but they were also
provided with rests for the head, such
as we are familiar with at our barbers’
and dentists’; and I was told that with
the body in the position proper to the
chairs, our emotional apparatus lent
itself most readily to suggestion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The author’s general guide—Vergil to his Dante.</p>

</div>

<p>I then asked him if the performance
was to be a good one, and he replied
that “The clutch was officially ranked
as A2 for efficiency, but that he did not
know what it was for.” I was much
puzzled as to his meaning until I
learnt that ‘clutch’ was the name given
to a drama of the kind about to take
place, where everything was under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
control of one man, the ‘fairfusser’ as
he is called, who designs the movement,
the emotional sequences, the
voices, and whatever else is needed. I
laid myself open to much banter on the
part of Ierne<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by asking whether it was
to be a tragedy or a comedy: such a
crude distinction, she said, was typical
of the muddle-headedness of our age,
on a level with the antitheses classical-romantic,
conservative-liberal, matter-mind,
and even intellect-emotion we
were so fond of making, and which for
absurdity were only equalled by our
craze for dressing men and women in
different sorts of clothes. The object
of a drama, Fabian enlightened me,
was to summon up a given state of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
being, pure or complex; and once the
fairfusser knew what the clutch was
for, it was his business to produce the
right emotion. I began to speak of
emotion for its own sake, but Ierne
hurriedly checked me, saying that I
would shock anyone who might overhear,
for there was no biological value
in emotion for its own sake. This
made me think less agreeably of her
kindness to me on the last evening.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> The author’s guide in the more intimate
social relationships.</p>

</div>

<p>I was therefore still confused by
their speaking of what a clutch was
‘for,’ as though it might be a sort of
charity matinée, and was about to put
the question, when the theatre became
pitch dark: the clutch was beginning.</p>

<p>At first I was aware only that the
roof, or ‘stage’ had become luminous,
the light varying in strength, as it does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
on the ceiling of a room when clouds
travel across the sun. Soon it became
more steadily bright, and vague human
figures began to take shape on it,
shadows at first, some of enormous
size, advancing and retreating, making
wide gestures of an import I could not
grasp. Sometimes the shadows would
assume solid shape and stand up as live
beings, seeming to detach themselves
from the dome so as not to appear in
the least like those extravagant persons
who populate the ceilings of many of
our own theatres: and among them was
one singularly graceful form which
seemed to dominate the rest, and whose
motions I could not help following, so
great was the pleasure they gave me.</p>

<p>Soon I became conscious that the
air of the theatre was pulsating in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
manner which never quite became
sound, and in a definite rhythm, which
varied occasionally, but yet seemed to
conform to the original beat, much as
a poet will modulate his verse. Now a
faint perfume hit the sense, while an
uneasy feeling stole over me, as if
something had been done I did not
want. Then, from the body of the
theatre, as from a member of the
audience, a voice spoke, in the tones
of a man resigned to grief:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">No means at all to hide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Man from himself can find:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No way to start aside.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Out of the hell of mind.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">and I felt myself sinking into such an
agony of despair as I can remember
having gone through only in dreams,
or under the influence of supernatural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
fear. Struggle as I might against the
weight of oppression, I was forced to
abandon myself to the flow of dire
tribulation, in which remorse succeeded
terror, and all the passions of the
world were black. And from all around
the theatre, now from here, now from
there, above me and below me, sometimes
in front and sometimes at my
back, I could hear voices and the noise
of approaching events. Once I thought
a voice cried out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Desolate, as she is desolate, in
ruined cities, and when the sun has
gone down to his rest.</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">and in the midst of a tumult of pulsations
and perfumes and shadowy
occurrences, a woman whispered, it
seemed close by my ear:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And Pity, like a naked, new-born babe.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">At that the sense of intolerable woe
lightened; the rhythm changed, the
figures appeared human and brave,
while joy seemed to issue from the very
walls of the theatre with the words:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Love’s banners on the battlements of song,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">which trickled from every side. At
last, without warning, in a triumphant
burst of sudden glory such as makes
us laugh with active lungs, a loud but
harmonious cry resounded from the
very middle of the theatre, where
there was nothing visible but empty
air, calling:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Where are the eagles and the trumpets?</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p class="noi">and I remembered no more till we
found ourselves perched on the outer
landing of the theatre waiting for our
taxi to take us home.</p>

<p>It was then that I found myself prey
to strange and mingled, but insistent
emotions, partly of kindly generosity,
and partly of self-sacrifice. Looking
at the men and women around me I
could see that they too were strongly
moved, making gestures foreign to the
occasion, such as taking out their
pocket-books, searching in them feverishly,
and doing sums on slips of paper.
Some whom I could see were giving
themselves up to despair, and others
were arguing with their wives. Fabian
then pointed out to me that most of
the carriages taking people away from
the theatre, instead of flying in all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
directions, made for a building upon
which was written large</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noi">SUBSCRIBE HERE FOR THE EURBANK LOAN. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <span class="flright">OFFICES OPEN.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 clearright">That, he said, accounted for the
clutch. There was a crisis, he continued,
in the bank upon which the credit of
the League of Europe was founded,
and the governments were anxious to
sell the scrip of the new loan. The
clutch we had seen had, no doubt, been
performed that afternoon in the larger
towns all over the continent, the language
alone being suitably varied;
and by this means the bank would be
placed on a firm footing once more.
My emotion was damped on learning
this, for after all, I could have little
interest in the finances of a country in
which I had no stake: but enough of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
my feeling was left to make me give a
foolishly large tip to the driver of our
machine.</p>

<p>I was naturally curious to know by
what means the frame of mind had
been aroused, and in the evening
Fabian was kind enough to enlighten
me, going very learnedly into the
origins of the form which met with
such success. I was very surprised,
and not a little proud, to find that a
large part of the science had had its
starting point in our own day, as he
showed from several old books: but he
on his part seemed inclined to think we
had been wanting in genius to have had
so much knowledge to hand, and yet
not have been able to use it.</p>

<p>The shape of the theatre had been
chosen for acoustic reasons, on account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
of certain properties of the hyperbola,
which I had not the mathematics to
understand, but which, Fabian said, had
been utilised in the third (1914–1918)
of the five great wars of European
settlement, for finding out by their
report, the exact post of hidden guns.
It was this which had enabled the fairfusser
to make the last cry seem to
come from the void; the other speeches
had merely been delivered by variously
placed loud-speakers, connected in due
turn with a wireless gramophone. I
may here say that the phrases I have
remembered and written down are only
a very small number of those used in
the performance, and which, for some
reason, seemed familiar. The other
words spoken in the clutch were of
like great emotive power, chosen or invented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
by the fairfusser for this reason
alone: and though they may seem to
have no logical thread, or connection
in real life, their place in the scheme
was very carefully thought out. The
reasons, and the terminology, for all
this were too far advanced for me to
be able to hold them in my head, but
I have since traced some passages
Fabian showed me as early sources of
the form, and which will give the
reader some idea of the great cleverness
of the design.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Thus the indirect methods of
hypnotising, like many of the technical
procedures used in making jokes,
have the effect of checking certain distributions
of mental energy which
would interfere with the course of
events in the unconscious, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
lead eventually to the same result as
the direct methods of influence by
means of staring or stroking.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From there the high road is plain to
see; the phrases of the clutch check or
loosen ‘certain distributions of mental
energy,’ for art is only a kind of
hypnotism: but the perfection which
I had ‘felt’ had not been arrived at
without much arduous trial. At one
time jumbled up words had been tried,
or single ones, but even the most striking,
such as <em>death</em>, or <em>beauty</em>, or <em>ruin</em>,
had not had an effect at all to be put
beside that of the shortest sentence.
Familiar quotations had also been
made use of, but they were put by for
two reasons. The first was that all
men did not respond in the same way,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
since all men are not equally noble,
some even finding risible “Tears, idle
tears, I know not what they mean.”
The second was that hardly any quotations
were familiar enough to be known
by everybody: for example, the words
“Till the conversion of the Jews”
moved people quite unevenly, some
connecting them with religion, others
with their pass-books, and a few with
an old obscure poem. This, besides
preventing many from entering into
the proper mood, destroyed that singleness
in the audience without which the
highest suggestible state cannot be
reached: for an emotion is infectious
only if the units of the crowd are
ready to agree together, as I have often
noticed on first nights when the friends
of an author try to sweep the critics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
away on a tide of noisy enthusiasm.
And further, emotion caught on the
wing is always stronger than when it is
the result of deliberate thought.</p>

<p>As to the shadows on the ‘stage,’
these were for fixing the attention of
all upon the same thing; and I discovered
that every member of the
audience had been greatly drawn towards
the figure which had seized
upon my imagination, and had to some
extent made himself one with it, as we
now do sometimes with the hero of a
play. This had served to transform
the loose ‘herd’ into a unified and thus
suggestible ‘horde,’ if I do not mistake
the terms.</p>

<p>The air being made to throb was
merely to create a rhythm, the effects
of which had been keenly studied.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Again to copy a passage I have traced:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Among the results of rhythm susceptibility
and vivacity of emotion,
limitations of the field of attention,
marked differences in the incidence of
belief feelings closely analogous to
those which alcohol and nitrous oxide
can induce ... may be noted.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noi">and I can willingly believe this, for I
have myself often felt very curiously
stirred when listening to the jazz-band
at young people’s parties.</p>

</div>

<p>The naming of nitrous oxide, or
laughing gas as it used to be called,
brings me to the perfumes, which, I
learnt, were led along each row of seats
by what I had taken for hot-water
pipes. This again, Fabian said, was a
legacy of the third (1914–1918) Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
War of European Settlement, and he
gave me to read an account I have
since recovered of a gas which caused
“the most appalling mental distress
and misery.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Of course the means
had been much refined, and the fairfusser
could at will set free gases
which brought about sorrow, fear, joy,
shame, the love of glory or of animals,
and indeed any emotion, all without
the least risk of harm; though it is
true that some serious mishaps,
especially in the early stages, had unluckily
happened.</p>

</div>

<p>The combined result was that almost
any feeling, and any required degree
of that feeling, could be produced by
the fairfusser, and this the government
found of the greatest use at times of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
political or European crisis, when wars
were to be declared or averted, or any
controversial measure passed.</p>

<p>I was bound to utter my high admiration
of the lengths to which the
art of the drama had been carried, and
made so salutary an influence, though
I could not help doubting whether
such a tool in the hands of rulers
might not be a little dangerous: but I
was assured that this had already been
foreseen, and that the national theatres
were closed during the period of a
general election, and of debates of high
moment, such as those on the budget.</p>

<p>I asked if there were no theatres in
which human beings came upon the
stage and strutted and talked after the
manner of common life, as they do to-day,
and I was told that there were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
many kinds: but that before going to
see them I would be taken to the
Dramatic Academy, which had been
handsomely endowed by an Anglo-Caucasian
millionaire. I thought I
should learn more of the trend of the
art by going there than by attendance
at a number of theatres, and gladly
consented to the proposal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br>
<small>THE DRAMATIC ACADEMY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>This academy is not an entire single
building, but a continuation of several
houses on both sides of a street, which
growing waste (owing to changes in
fashion), was purchased and applied to
that use. I was received very kindly
by the warden, and went for many
days to the academy.</p>

<p>This was composed in three parts;
one for research professors, another
for play-makers, or fairfussers, and
the third for students; the first being
trained psychologists, the last, young
men and women remarkable for
beauty, fine feeling and intelligence, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
they are in our own day. The notion
was for the professors to find out facts,
for the fairfussers to apply them, and
for the students to carry them out: and
if it may occur to the reader that the
workers in one side paid small heed to
the discoveries of the rest, a little
consideration will show that this is all
to the good; for slavishly to accept
the opinions of others can never lead
to clarity of thought, and the warden
was anxious to maintain in every inmate
that active spirit of self-reliance
without which no advance can be made
in any of the sciences. I saw many of
each division, but to write of them all
would be to take up inordinate space
in these memorials, since the arts are
not of large importance to the state or
to the public. I shall, therefore, confine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
myself to describing one or two of
each kind, choosing those which throw
most light on the methods of those
days, and the great progress we can
shortly expect.</p>

<p>My first visit was to a small, active
professor, with a tiny clean-shaven
chin, and unusually bright weasel eyes,
who, speaking very fast, and with
vivid gesture, easily convinced me of
the usefulness of his discoveries. He
had applied his mind for fifteen years
to proving that there was no such thing
as thought, for, he said, the conversation
he had to listen to, or the acts he
was able to observe, could be accounted
for without supposing such a thing
existed. Speech, he explained, was
merely a habit, like that of scratching
when something causes our skin to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
itch; and, moreover, all our deeds
were like scratching, which we do
thoughtlessly, however much we may
flatter ourselves that we prepare great
things far ahead. He did not go to the
lengths of some of his colleagues, who
denied the existence of consciousness:
for, so as not to be too positive, he
preferred to regard ‘awareness of the
emotions’ as a fiction convenient to his
purpose, or, to put it differently, as
words merely to describe a sequence
of events. By his system, when impulses
are set up, something occurs,
such as eating, and we are ‘satisfied,’
as we say: or we are ‘disappointed,’
as when prevented from a kindly
action.</p>

<p>I paid close heed to this part of his
discourse, because he begged me not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
to confuse his theory with that of a
rival professor, who believed that
allusive gestures gave rise to a corresponding
emotion. This, he pointed out,
was merely the out-of-date heresy that
“A dog does not wag his tail because
he is happy; but that he is happy
because his tail wags.” This rival
believed that if he made the gestures
which usually go with certain emotions,
he would undergo these feelings; and
the spectator would, by ‘in-feeling’ or
‘empathy’ (such were his barbarous
terms) put their muscles in readiness
to go through these movements, and
so, in their turn, experience these
emotions. For his part, when he had
been to see this professor acting woe,
far from feeling unhappy, he had
barely been able to master his mirth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
But, so as to give the theory a fair trial,
he had wished with one of his pupils to
observe the result of moving the tail
of a dog quickly from side to side, but
that unluckily, the pupil had been
bitten before the experiment had
reached a stage from which anything
could be learnt.</p>

<p>His own idea, he informed me, was
to set up a known order of stresses and
strains in the watchers’ nerves, and
this could be done by cunning movements
performed in front of them. I
was not, however, to tax him with inconsistency,
for his motto was ‘Not
miming but movement,’ and though
an actor had to use gestures, they must
by no means be after the naif manner
of his rival. He himself had spent
over four years in the abstract study of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the movements proper to the passion
of benevolence—abstract, because
nothing is more misleading than what
people relate of their own feelings:
cruelty, for instance, they often describe
as a wish to better their neighbours.
Indeed, another of his mottoes,
he declared chuckling, was ‘No motion,
no emotion’; and I could not but agree
with him when I considered that after
all, to lie in one’s bed all day and
simply ‘think,’ as we stupidly call it,
is no life at all.</p>

<p>Yet I could not help trying to argue,
feebly enough, that the showing of
dreadful acts would call forth feelings
of horror, as we may judge from the
murder of Desdemona, and that fitting
words would arouse pity in us, as they
do in the same play. But, smiling at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the clumsiness of my example, he remarked
that just there lay the error;
for if we were truly to see a Moor,
however splendid, plunging a knife
into the body of a beautiful lady, our
emotions, if we knew her to be guiltless,
would be very different from
those we feel in a theatre; and that,
instead of sitting still, we should most
certainly interpose, or run to fetch the
police. Again, while we were children,
before our minds are distorted by what
we erroneously call thought (but
which is only an idle luxury-habit),
Mr Punch beating his wife causes us
to laugh very loudly. This instance, he
said, would also prove how much more
useful movements were than words,
since for ten who would laugh at a
Punch and Judy show, hardly one would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
smile at the wittiest things in Pascal. It
was only on reflection that I could altogether
make his views my own, for it
is not easy for us to give up opinions we
have held ever since we can remember.</p>

<p>To test the movements appropriate
to various emotions, this professor had
invented a machine, which, by reason
of the changes in electrical resistance
a body undergoes under the action of
the passions, recorded the feelings of
any person subjected to it. This
machine he had just brought to perfection,
and to give me a demonstration,
he sat me in a chair made of some
amalgam unknown to me, and fitted
with sockets into which my head, hands
and feet were clamped. A piece of
wireless apparatus, supplied with a
diaphragm such as make a part of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
telephone receivers, was placed over
my heart, and, my loins being bared,
my lumbar vertebrae were played upon
by a peculiar ray. Above my head,
where I could not see it, was placed a
marker, much like our telegraph
morse-code dials, but corrugated and
rayed after the manner of a fan. The
professor could watch this while evolving
before me the strange movements I
could connect with nothing I had ever
seen, and so could vary his gestures according
to the results shown. After
about a quarter of an hour of erudite
passes, the professor, wiping the sweat
from his brow, triumphantly announced
the successful issue of his experiment,
and asked me what emotion
I felt. At that moment, having overcome
my awe, I was filled with a profound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
sense of pity, and on my confessing
this, the professor danced with
glee. Crying “Typical! Typical!” he
pointed at the dial; but as the needle
showed ‘Lust tempered with Sentimentality’
I could not but feel that his
wonderful invention needed alteration
in a few details to perfect it. Nevertheless,
while doing up my braces, I framed
a few remarks to make known my
pleasure at seeing the drama make such
strides in his hands; and promising to
meet at a later day we parted with
many expressions of esteem. I must
also add this tribute to his ability: when
I did visit him again, very fast, on my
backward journey through time, even
when all the motions were reversed,
I once more felt very deeply the
compassion his gestures had provoked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>I next went to see a fairfusser,
though not one in the service of the
government, and was much impressed
by his freedom from doubt as to the
way in which the best result was to be
reached. He said, with justice, that the
artist’s desire was to communicate with
his fellow creatures, and that the object
of an actor was to place his soul in
touch with that of others. Man, being
in each case a unique individual, was
fitted for work more noble than that
of a mere interpreter, or conduit pipe
from an author to an audience, and the
contrary view had been the grand
error of all producers from the time
of Shakespeare almost to his own day.
The aim of an actor was to express
himself (as a part of universal nature)
and reveal a cup overbrimming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
with passions. Any ideas introduced
by an author were to be deprecated, for
his business was strictly to provide the
raw material; and so the teacher’s main
efforts were to be directed towards
training his pupils to rid the author’s
words of any meaning they might contain,
simply by the manner of speaking
them. In this way nothing was allowed
to come between the actor and
the audience. This he claimed to be
the especial discovery of his age, and
one which he could not help regarding
with more than a little pride.</p>

<p>I made bold to tell him that his
notion was not so new as he imagined,
and that we too had actors who disbelieved
that words had any plausible
meaning apart from the emotion the
actor could register through them:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
men (as a rule well set up, or even
bulky, since these are always the most
passionate) who by a clever alteration
in stress, or an abrupt cleavage of a
sentence in the middle, could effectively
cancel any extraneous idea the
words of an author might interpose
between the feelings of the player and
the minds of the audience. This constructor
was good enough to say that
he was quite sure our age had not been
so dark as was commonly supposed, but
that, at least in our classical plays,
which had been in verse, a form which
compels a certain manner of speech, he
thought the ‘pure’ actor must have met
with difficulties hardly to be overcome.
I was able to assure him that this was
not so, and that, indeed, it was just in
these very plays many of our actors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
had shown their highest genius; that
one might know <cite>Hamlet</cite>, for example,
quite well by the book, and yet go to
two or three versions of the play and
hardly recognise any of the speeches,
so much were they heightened and
made subtle in the speaking of them.</p>

<p>I was also much taken by an investigator
who had made a highly
diverting play simply with scenery,
and a few mutes who now and again
varied their place. It was his view that
we had always been astray in making
people the centre of our dramas: it
was their surroundings that mattered—for
who, he said, given the choice of
seeing Brown eat his dinner, or a
thunderstorm on Mount Everest,
would not prefer to look at Mount
Everest? A modern producer could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
help laughing at the remark of Aristotle,
if he ever read it, that ‘the spectacle
was the least artistic part of a
drama.’ A comely staircase, he averred,
or even a rickety ladder, if it was tall
enough, had more significance than a
tale of hopeless love; and he was about
to design a series of scenes in a logical
order of forms and colours, green following
pink, which would make a
spectator sadder than even a play by
Sophocles. This I could well believe:
but I found it hard to understand how
it was right to allude to pink as though
it were a premiss, for after all, nobody
dreams of calling a rainbow a syllogism,
any more than they do of saying
‘paradox’ when they mean a hill.</p>

<p>On another day I was taken to see a
fairfusser at work on an old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
play which was to be ‘acted,’ in our
sense of the word, by students. He
made his actors rehearse a scene; and
then all sat down on chairs and took
up stereoscopic glasses. Immediately,
at the other end of the room, two coloured
films appeared, exactly reproducing
the movements of the actors,
while at the same time a gramophone
repeated the words they had uttered,
in such a manner as to seem to come
from the mouth of each actor who
spoke. With the glasses the illusion
was complete, and I could hardly believe
I was not re-dreaming the scene
I had just witnessed, except that the
producer could stop the play at will, or
even go back to a phrase or gesture to
point out the errors of voice or movement
of which the actors had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
guilty. He could also show how a
gesture would be more effective if performed
at a greater or less speed; and
how admirable this method was I
could judge from the looks of pleasure
or mortification on the actors’ faces
as they saw themselves displayed.</p>

<p>There was one handsome young
actor who seemed by his vehemence
and assurance to be more talented than
the rest, and to him I asked to be introduced,
that I might learn his views
from him. He led me aside, and with
great earnestness explained to me how
experience had shown that one could
not take for granted the least intelligence
in an audience. Words, he said,
conveyed nothing to them unless accompanied
with appropriate action:
and this he ascribed to the fact that an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
audience was a crowd, and therefore
followed the normal law of mass
psychology in being much stupider and
more primitive than a single person.
The actor, therefore, had to deal with
the simplest objects or ideas, indicating
them by a kind of airy drawing.
The connection between them, the
grammar or the syntax as it were (so
he was kind enough to phrase it for
my understanding) was portrayed by
the actors’ emotion as expressed in
gesture or tone. That was why plays
with few words were better than plays
with many words, as in the latter case
the number of gestures became very
tiring both to the eyes of the audience
and the muscles of the actors. He
had a noble, yet reasoned, scorn for
any player who stood still and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
hardly a movement allowed sentences
merely to trundle out of his mouth,
and he considered his place could very
well be taken by a gramophone.</p>

<p>To illustrate the stages of his art, he
took me to a room to see a young
actress practice an easy passage, and
I was much gratified by the manner in
which she expressed by gesture the
meaning of the words she was uttering;
and I could not but admire the subtle
difference she made in pointing to the
floor when she said in one case ‘down’
meaning merely downstairs, in another
the infernal regions. The same variation
was introduced in her rendering
of ‘up,’ and I did not fail to note that
each gesture emphasised a new beauty
in her arms. She also practised some
‘tone-work’ as they call it, and for my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
benefit declaimed an old-fashioned
line “To lie in cold obstruction and to
rot,” and it is hard to imagine, as it is
impossible to describe, the frigidity she
put into the word ‘cold,’ or the horror
and loathing with which she vivified
the word ‘rot,’ so making their meaning
quite clear to any audience.</p>

<p>My actor friend afterwards told me
that she had sadly bungled the word
‘obstruction,’ because she had not yet
reached the year in which abstract
terms were studied; and being himself
nearly at the conclusion of that period,
he gave me a finished version of the
line “The quality of mercy is not
strained,” which quite transported me,
and which I should not know how to
praise sufficiently. The gesture for
‘quality,’ initially too simple, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
raised to a high state of complexity by
the young man’s genius, and I should
no doubt have understood it perfectly
had I been more used to the method.</p>

<p>I later asked the young woman if
such interpretation did not involve
work almost too arduous, since nothing
is more tiring than to bring one’s ideas
to the level of common minds; and
she told me that though the intellectual
labour was harder than in any
other profession, their task was lessened
by the fact that so few authors
had any idea of what they really
meant that the actors could substitute
such phrases as lent themselves more
readily to their temperament.</p>

<p>There was another actor, with a
mobile mouth and masterful manner,
whom I saw practising for his thirty-third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
performance of a part, and therefore
engaged in working out a thirty-third
reading. I was amazed at this,
which is so contrary to our own
method, but was soon persuaded of its
rightness. For a work of art, this actor
said, did not exist apart from the observer—it
was a collaboration; and as
no observer was ever twice in the same
mood, he could never experience the
same sensation from the identical
thing. One might say, to adapt the
words of an old Greek sophist, “No
man can go to the same play twice.”
He then went on to argue very brilliantly
that since the actor made the
work of art, was indeed himself a piece
of it, his share of the collaboration was
to make it on each occasion as different
as possible from the last, so as to help<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
any observer who might come more
than once to any play. (He knew several
ladies who had been to see him no
less than seventeen times in the same
character). This also had the extra
advantage of avoiding that dull
monotony—for what is art without an
element of surprise?—so often to be
seen in our actors, who think they have
achieved a final rendering, and attempt
day after day to repeat a thing which
can never really occur even twice.</p>

<p>I was much satisfied at what I had
seen and learnt at the Academy, but
was made slightly melancholy by the
thought that if ever I should return to
my own time, I should find our actors
and actresses much below the level of
what I had come to expect from their
calling.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III<br>
<small>OTHER THEATRES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The National theatre which I have
described was not, of course, the only
kind, though it had many imitators;
and I shall now pass to some others,
beginning with that which I think will
most interest readers of the present
day, but which was rarely mentioned in
the polite society of the age. This was
the Cathartic Theatre, where people
went to be cured of the passion of love.
In our day, as has been for many generations
past, we often refer to love-sickness
but it is half in jest, and there
are few of us who do not think the
undoubted pains of the state amply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
repaid with its joys. Its dangers,
however, now only beginning to be
recognised, were fully taken into account
in 2,100, for it was seen that the
claims of society were incompatible
with an emotion then relegated to the
songs of derivative poets. Already we
know that the battle between the self
and the ideal social self gives rise to the
most frightful diseases, but in our day
we only try to cure the unhealthy
symptom instead of going to the root
of the matter and abolishing the cause.
At this time, though the malady was
well in hand, its approaches were so insidious
that patients going to a doctor
for what they thought was one sickness
would often be surprised by a diagnosis
which convicted them of love, and
would later be seen entering the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Cathartic Theatre with shamed faces
or that air of studied indifference we
assume when we do not wish to be
noticed, thinking that by this method
we shall appear to have no face at all.</p>

<p>The theory of this theatre was very
simple; and this too, I was proud to
think, had been foreshadowed by
writers of our own time, one of whom
had written, “We have lost the orgy,
but in its place we have art,”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
another “Poetry acts as a physician.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The aim of the performance was to
break down the obstacles we wrongly
oppose to our thoughts in rude
attempts to fit ourselves to social life,
and so allow to drain away those impulses
which in any really harmonious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
nature should never be set up. I must
warn the reader of this age not to
confuse the method with one of ‘sublimation’
as we say, for this involves
the ‘will,’ a fiction of which the futility
had long been exposed. It is true
that I did not very clearly grasp these
matters, which are too far beyond our
time—just as Dryden would, perhaps,
have found it hard to grasp the true
subtleties of Expressionism—but I
hope I do not err in saying that an
element of vicarious fulfilment also
entered into these dramas, on the
ground, which no one will contradict,
that it is the function of art to provide
what everyday life denies us. The
name of the theatre, I found indeed,
had arisen from that reading of Aristotle
which confuses the meaning of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Catharsis with that of ‘purgation by
excess’: for even in those days the
Faculty of Medicine was not always
happy in the names it chose for the ills
and remedies it invented.</p>

<p>The authorities were, of course,
fully aware of the risks run in using
such a specific, and its abuse was hindered
in the same way as we curtail
the buying of opium and other drugs,
which wrongly applied prove harmful;
and a man was only able to buy a
ticket if he showed a paper signed by a
doctor to declare him a fitting subject.
Medical men were themselves allowed
to buy as many tickets as they liked,
and a large percentage of the audience
was always composed of them, because
they wished to observe the effects of
the cure upon their patients. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
not without difficulty that Fabian was
able to get us the needful pass, and it
was only after representing to the
authorities that any account of their
age which omitted so beneficial a device
would be very faulty, that I was
granted it.</p>

<p>Before entering the theatre Fabian
told me to abandon myself freely to
any impulse to laugh, as that was a
condition of perfect purging: and of
this I was very glad, for I have often,
not only before, but since my visit to
this time, felt the pain of constraint at
light plays, especially if I was with
relatives, or else friends with whom
I did not wish to become too intimate.
But what was my surprise to find,
instead of the fescennine jesting I was
prepared for, a play I had already seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
in Manchester, a drama of the most
correct sentiment by one of our notably
respectable, even titled playwrights,
which might call forth smiles and tears
alternately, but not those crude outbursts
of mirth I now heard on every
side. So little was I able to enter into
the spirit of the thing that after the
first act Fabian took me out, whispering
to me that my callous behaviour might
have the worst effect upon the patients
seated near me. He seemed to think
my bearing had been of set purpose,
and only grudgingly gave the explanation
I longed for, which was that the
people in these times saw a wealth of
allusion lurking beneath the innocent
phrases; and that what the audience
so much relished and admired in our
author was the simplicity with which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
he had hidden the ‘latent content’
under the ‘manifest.’ When I protested
my belief that nothing had been
more remote from the writer’s mind,
Fabian looked coldly at me, as though
he were sure I was trying to dupe him.</p>

<p>It was in vain that I pleaded with
him to be allowed to attend another
of these plays, one of later date, for
Fabian would by no means recommend
me for a pass, saying that the sense
would certainly be beyond me. There
was, however, another level of play of
the same nature, designed for the
stupider sort of people, such as members
of Parliament, wardens of libraries,
teachers in science or religion at
the Public Schools, municipal architects
and so on, for which, not without a
contemptuous word, he recommended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
me. He excused his own absence,
however; for even, he said, if he could
obtain permission, which he doubted,
he would not care to go. And indeed,
after I had seen the piece, I could not
blame him. For determined as I was,
this time, to behave with propriety,
I allowed myself the license of which
we are all guilty sometimes, when our
conscience, or ‘censor’ to use the
modern term, is off its guard; and
laughing very heartily, I have since
felt ashamed at my acquiescence in a
remedy that must prove so greatly
worse than the disease. The least
things there were such as make us keep
some of our Callot etchings locked in a
drawer, and to leave certain portions
of Mr Loeb’s excellent library in the
original tongue, though some I am told,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
regard this only as an ingenious device
to outwit the laziness of students. At
all events, since I was not ill, the performance,
I fear, did me no good:
whether it would have done so in less
happy conditions I am unable to tell,
and I dwell upon it no longer, as in
any case the experiment will not, I
think, be tried in our day, even in the
hospitals. Nor would I be convinced
of the wisdom of the venture if it were.</p>

<p>In going about the streets I had
often noticed, especially in the business
quarters, what appeared to be shops or
booths, not unlike those places one
may see abroad, where men sit in rows
to have their boots polished. Above
them was displayed a sign on which was
written “Two Minutes,” or “Thirty
Seconds,” or some like period of time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
I had seen the backs of men standing
in lines, with pads clamped over their
ears and their faces pushed forward
into a sort of camera, and had supposed
these retreats to be telephone boxes.
I was much surprised when Ierne told
me they were “Hurry Theatres,” and
invited me to accompany her to one
of them.</p>

<p>They were erected, as the name
implies, for those without the leisure
to attend longer performances, and
were found very beneficial to brokers
and such, who, hurrying from their
offices to snatch their midday meal,
could pause for the declared number
of seconds, and gain, without waste
of time, a modicum of ‘organised
emotion,’ as Ierne called it; and this
was often a great relief to them. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
when we are too much troubled by our
affairs we may usefully go to art for
escape or refreshment. There were a
few booths in the more fashionable
parts, for errand boys, journalists, and
taxi-drivers, while it was found that
those in the dentists’ quarter were
much patronised: for in going to have
our teeth seen to, if we do not like to
be late, yet we shrink from entering
the place until the last moment,
although the waiting rooms are made
homely and cheerful with time-tables,
comic papers, and copies of Academy
pictures. These theatres were also
agreeable to those who had arranged
to meet friends at a certain spot and
were kept waiting, and some had even,
in the early days, gained a notoriety
as rendezvous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>The camera through which one
looked was simply a stereoscopic glass
directed on a double film screen, and
the pads were the telephone receivers
through which one heard the voices of
the actors, which seemed to come from
their mouths. The plays themselves
were most dramatic in character, since
their object was to endue the spectator
with a highly disturbing emotion in a
minimum of time. They were therefore
very allusive, and I should have
found it hard to understand many of
them if the gestures and tones of the
actors had not been profoundly striking.
I grew to be fond of them and,
indeed, with weakly emotional men,
they readily become a vice; for when
thrills are as easily obtained as cocktails,
and as rapidly swallowed, if I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
may use the term, they form a tonic as
difficult to resist as any digestive, and
are perhaps as harmful.</p>

<p>It would be useless for me to write
down a typical drama, for the reader
of to-day would not follow it, nor, for
that matter, relish it more than he does
those quaint old seventeenth-century
plays where women dress up as men,
and blood so freely flows. There were,
indeed, a few from our own era, known
as ‘classics,’ and sometimes acted as
curiosities in the neighbourhood of
museums, but the earliest of these
must date, I think, from at least 1940,
and was a comedy with the strange
title <cite>The Psycho-Fans</cite>. A young man
wishing to make a girl his bride, she
puts him through a number of scientific,
but comical tests, to prove his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
worth and his affection: she was afraid,
I gathered, that he might turn out to
be an ‘introvert,’ and not at all a
suitable mate for an ‘extravert’ such
as she was. All I remember of the
words is the opening of a sort of epilogue
he spoke:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh had I wist</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before I kissed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That you were a Behaviourist....</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Normally, however, these dramas
aimed at producing dread, and I
naturally avoided one which was advertised
as “Guaranteed to make your
soul writhe.” We are not yet made
of such stern stuff as to derive courage
to face the battle of life from art of
this sort, though I have seen robust
clerks stagger from these booths with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
white faces and a much increased zest
for their humdrum labours. This being
so, I had the temerity to suggest that
one of these theatres might be installed
in each government office for the use
of civil servants, and am gratified to
be able to say that my proposal was
acted upon, only the Inland Revenue
Department being excepted.</p>

<p>There was one theatre which several
young people told me was the best,
but as it did not meet with general
favour, I did not go there until the end
of my visit, for I have always felt an
abhorrence of what is at all precious,
and avoided the highbrow and snobbish.
It was quite a mean place, not in
the capital but in a small provincial
town, and was regulated by a fairfusser
who had never been able to make his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
way in a decent centre, owing to his
poor skill in the art of advertisement.</p>

<p>The stage was much like that which
we know, but though built in pleasant
enough proportions was too simply
decorated to be striking. The settings
were so unobtrusive that at the end of
a scene one could hardly say whether
the framing had been good or bad,
which I thought a pity, for one was in
this manner robbed of a subject for
conversation. The effects were obtained
chiefly by the lighting, but unfortunately
this was kept uniform throughout
each scene, and thus one lost the
pleasure of admiring the agility of the
electrician, who nowadays, is, with his
switches, as great a virtuoso as an
organist with his stops. The most
noticeable difference was the stage being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
only about two-thirds the size of
ours, the reason for it that the actors
were not people, but puppets, rather
smaller than human beings.</p>

<p>I have always regarded these dolls
as a mistake, for they must needs be
anonymous, and how can one tell if
the acting is good if one does not know
the name of the performers? I think
too, that if one is to have puppets at
all, they should be either grotesque or
fairy-like, and these were neither, resembling
instead those early Egyptian
or Indian sculptures we have so far
out-distanced, or those Byzantine
paintings, which, once thought beautiful,
would look so oddly on the walls
of Burlington House. I must confess
that their movements were graceful,
their deftness above that of any human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
being, but not more so than one
could imagine human beings capable
of. They were actuated, not by
strings, but by some invisible power,
and everything they did seemed to be
of such happy invention that one felt
they had all nature at their command
to use. But I detected a grave error
in the way the fairfusser made the
words issue from their lips, for they
did not speak at all like actors, but
simply and swiftly, as we all try to do
in real life, and it is not for that we go
to the theatre. Their speeches were so
cadenced that they dwelt in the ear
like a harmony in music, which is contrary
to all experience, so that the
characters did not seem like men ennobled,
but, rather, fleshly embodiments
of the thought or feeling it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
their purpose to express. One enthusiast,
eager to convert me, quoted to
me the words of some foreign actress
of our time:<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> “To save the Theatre,
the Theatre must be destroyed, the actors
and actresses must all die of the
plague. They poison the air, they
make art impossible,” which is cruel
and absurd, and in any case should not
have come from an actress. For these
semblances of mankind by their remoteness
banished all the accidental
things which make a play realistic and
warmly human, and all the personal
emotion which makes us feel for an
actor, and applaud him for the pain he
has gone through. But we cannot feel
for a puppet, or applaud him, even if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
he has played King Lear, for we know
his sufferings were not real.</p>

<p>These plays were always made entirely
by one man—for this fairfusser
actually had one or two disciples—who
directed each movement, whether
of single persons or crowds, either
tumultuous, or in the dances, which
met with much applause, though they
seemed to me even less comprehensible
than some of the later Russian ballets
which were lately in vogue for a short
time. I was told he was always very
careful about the ‘rhythmic order’ of
the piece, whatever that may mean,
and its groupings. All was done first
on a little model, which in the end became
a record repeated on the larger
scale. For the voices he took human
beings, going over and over each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
phrase until he got exactly the tone he
wanted, and these he recorded, timing
them afterwards with the movements,
so that the whole play went, as it were,
by clockwork. Thus there was nothing
spontaneous about it, and this is a
fault, since art, according to many
serious philosophers, is a kind of
game, and thus, surely, if any notion
of being drilled creeps in, the pleasure
evaporates.</p>

<p>The same man also, as a rule, wrote
the words, which did not remain in my
memory because I understood them so
little, seeing that they dealt with
thoughts and feelings which in our
day we take small notice of. That this
must be so is easy to see; for every age
concerns itself with a different relation
of man to what is outside him. We are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
now, to be sure, beginning to do what
they were doing,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in dealing with man’s
relation to man’s idea of what he is;
that is, so to say in the plain words of
Albertus Magnus, seeking “the causation
of causes in the causes of things.”
But these plays bewildered me, as I
own without shame, for would not Dr.
Johnson himself have been adrift at a
play by Signor Pirandello? And since
there was so much I could not fathom,
I should only impart a false twist to
the meaning however much I tried to
give a true account.</p>

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> In 2,100 O. S.</p>

</div>

<p>But I fear these plays disordered
me, for the unnatural is a sort of
poison, and I have never since been
able to feel real pleasure at any drama
of to-day even in the best theatres in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Paris, New York, or London. Indeed
I have almost conceived an aversion
from our stage; and it is only the
importunities of my friends that make
me go to a play once or twice in a year,
so as not to seem unsociable. If the
choice is left to me, we go to the
English version of a French farce, for
these are usually free from any meaning
at all: and if one expects nothing,
one cannot be disappointed.</p>
